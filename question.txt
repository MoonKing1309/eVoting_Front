5. College Voting System
The main activities in the application are the user login page for user. The other modules
are followed by this login page. This module records only user and password of the user.
Another main function of our proposed system is registration, in order to register with the
OTP. Admin will update the candidate details with voter id, date and ward of election
going to participate. Admin will create voter id list database and import by means of xls
or manual form post method in the android app and view the details of voter. This voter id
will act as the login id for the user side. While user login to the app, need to verify the
OTP to their mobile number registered with voter id. User can select the candidate listed
within the ward and submit the vote. Finally display the no of votes for each candidate.
